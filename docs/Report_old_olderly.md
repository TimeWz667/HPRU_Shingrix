# The technology evaluation of recombinant zoster vaccine for preventing herpes zoster in people aged 80 and above

## Background

### Figure 1: Baseline vaccine-induced immunity in 2023. (epidemiology models)

Notes: blue bars indicate the people have been vaccinated with ZVL prior to 2023; red bars indicate the people have immunity against HZ remains; percentage values above are the shares of population in respective age groups.


## Objectives

The aim of this research is to assess the cost-effectiveness of using RZV on people aged 80 years and older within the England immunisation programme for Shingles, with the following objectives. 

- Evaluating whether vaccination is cost-effective for those older than the previous eligible upper bound (79 years old). 
- Evaluating the feasibility of re-vaccination with RZV for those who were previously vaccinated with ZVL
- Assessing whether a booster is needed in compensating the waned immunity when they are getting older.

## Immunity gaps caused by expanding the eligiblity of RZV to 60-79

Notes: labels of panel indicate the current age of the individual; the x-axis is for the age at which they were vaccinated.

## Epidemiological projections

#### Scenarios
- **SOC**: merely replace ZVL by RZV without expanding eligiblity
- **Phase 1 only**: expanding to 65 years since 2028 only
- **Scheduled**: full scheduled policy
- **To 95 years since 2028**: **Scheduled** + expanding eligibility to 95 years since 2028
- **To 95 years since 2033**: **Scheduled** + expanding eligibility to 95 years since 2033
